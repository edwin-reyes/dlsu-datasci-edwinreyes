# Module 4: Data Visualization
This module builds on top of the previous modules and teaches you how to visualize the data that you have using `matplotlib`.

### Materials
Watch the accompanying videos provided in the class repository and follow along with the Jupyter notebooks provided here.

* [01_Data_Visualization.ipynb](01_Data_Visualization.ipynb)

### References
* [`matplotlib` Documentation](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [`seaborn` Documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
* [CARTOColors](https://carto.com/carto-colors/) - for color schemes
* [ColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/) - for color schemes (with print & colorblind safe checks)


### Exercise
After completing the lessons and the sample notebook, use the starter notebook to create a plot (or a series of subplots) using a dataset of your choosing. Detailed instructions are in the [Module 4 Exercise Jupyter Notebook](Module_4_Exercise.ipynb).

For the submission:
1. Upload the code that generates the plot to your GitHub repository or to Google Classroom (whichever method you're using for submissions).
2. Upload a png file of the visualization to Google Classroom and write in the Private Comments the caption for the figure you submitted.
3. Make sure to provide the data source in the same folder.
